## Mapping explanaition for SDM-Genomics-Dataset


- mapping-conf1: One Concept MA, and one Attribute MA.
- mapping-conf2: One Concept MA, and four Attribute MAs.
- mapping-conf3: Two Concept MA, one referenced-source role MA, and one attribute MA.
- mapping-conf4: Five Concept MAs, and four Referenced-source role MAs.
- mapping-conf5: Two Concepts MAs, and one Multi-source role MA.
- mapping-conf6: Five Concept MAs, and Four Multi-source role MAs
- mapping-AllTogether: Combines mapping-conf1, mapping-conf2, mapping-conf3, mapping-conf4, mapping-conf5, and mapping-conf6 one mapping configuration.


## Additional configurations for SWJ2022 paper:
- mapping-conf7: Four Concept MAs, and two Multi-source role MAs. This configuration seeks to evaluate the impact of defining the mapping-same predicates using different MAs.
- mapping-conf8: Six Concept and five Multi-source role MAs. This mapping configuration aims to recreate a five-star join where five MAs refer to the same parent MA.
- mapping-conf9: Eight Concept and seven Multi-source role MAs. This configuration combines mapping-conf7 and mapping-conf8 into one mapping configuration.
